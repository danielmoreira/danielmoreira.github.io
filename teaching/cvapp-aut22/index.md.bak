## Overview
How might Google or TinEye reverse image search operate?
How can a computer program process the pixel values of images and video frames and classify the depicted scene,
or leverage the captured faces to perform person identification?
What about manipulated images with tools such as Photoshop?
Are there methods to help to debunk these manipulations?
These are some of the questions we will be addressing in this course,
focusing on state-of-the-art Computer Vision (CV) solutions to reduce the semantic gap
between the pixel values and the desired outcome of complex tasks such as content-based image retrieval,
content classification and recognition, biometric identification, and media forensics,
always with the [greater good](https://danielmoreira.github.io/post/bettersoc/) in mind.
Requirements to attend this course are basic programming skills (especially Python) and statistics and probability.

> Students will have to do at most eight assignments.
> Each assignment will comprise a particular set of scientific articles.
> Students will have to choose one of the articles for each assignment and provide a summary on the due date.
> There is no limit of pages for the summaries.
> Each summary should contain:  
> (1) **What** is the problem addressed in the article?  
> (2) **Why** is it important to address this problem?  
> (3) **How** do the authors address the problem?  
> (4) What are the authors' **claims**?  
> (5) What **methodology** did they adopt (e.g., datasets, problem metrics, experiments) to prove their claims?  
> (6) Do you agree with the authors' claims?  
> (7) For the graduate students, how do you think you may use this work in your research?  
> (8) What open questions do you have about the article?  

-----------
## Discussion Leaders
* CBIR and Indexing, TBD *(students)*, on 09/26.
* Image Classification, TBD *(students)*, on 10/03.
* Object Detection, TBD *(students)*, on 10/17.
* Image Segmentation, TBD *(students)*, on 10/24.
* Face Detection, TBD *(students)* on 10/31.
* Face Verification, TBD *(students)* on 11/07.
* GANs and Generative DL, TBD *(students)*, on 11/14.
* Provenance Analysis, TBD *(students)*, on 12/05.

> Each student will play the role of *discussion leader* twice along the course.
> Students will lead discussion in groups, preferably in pairs of one graduate and one undergraduate student.
> The graduate students are expected to help their undergraduate peers.  
> 
> Discussion leaders will be responsible for organizing a 1.5-hour presentation of the topic of the day,
> resorting to slides, videos, and demonstrations.
> The instructor advises the discussion leaders to share their material with him
> a couple of days before the presentation day.  
> Discussion leaders will also receive the summaries of the articles and open questions related to their topics
> from the other students at least 5 days before their presentation.
> 
> The topics of the assignments and for discussion coincide; as a consequence, discussion leaders are not required to
> provide summaries for the topics they will present.

> Each student has two *"Oopsie"* cards (OC), which will allow them to avoid losing points because of absence
> or extend due dates until 12/11.
> They may use an OC at their discretion for any task, except for their assigned days of discussion leadership
> and final exam.
> Please let the instructor know you will need your OC.

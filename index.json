Given a questioned image, namely a probe, and a large corpus of images (such as the Internet), Provenance Analysis aims at two major tasks:\n Finding the images that directly and transitively share content with the probe (a task we call Provenance Filtering).\n Building the directed acyclic graph whose nodes individually represent the probe and related images, and whose edges express the edition and content-donation history (e.g., cropping, blurring, removal, splicing, etc.) between pairs of images, linking seminal to generated elements (a task we call Provenance Graph Construction).\n  By combining ideas from the areas of image retrieval, digital image forensics, and graph theory, Provenance Analysis constitutes an interesting interdisciplinary topic that spans the fields of image processing and computer vision.\nResearch Team  Prof. Walter Scheirer (PI) Prof. Anderson Rocha (PI) Prof. Kevin Bowyer (PI) Prof. Patrick Flynn (PI) Daniel Moreira (Postdoc) Aparna Bharati (PhD Student) Joel Brogan (PhD Student) Allan Pinto (PhD Student) Michael Parowski (Undergrad Student) Patricia Hale (Undergrad Student) William Badart (Undergrad Student)  ","date":1559347200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559347200,"objectID":"2ce2b93ee954a04842b88663b1a80847","permalink":"https://danielmoreira.github.io/project/medifor/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/medifor/","section":"project","summary":"Integrity assessment of digital images through content provenance analysis.","tags":["Media Forensics","Provenance Analysis","Provenance Filtering","Provenance Graph Construction"],"title":"MediFor","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Status: Wrapping up\nAdvisor: Prof. Patrick Flynn\nThe SREFV project aims at extending prior research on synthesis of realistic faces, to support the generation of videos containing animated faces with synthetic identities, depicted either frontally or in varying poses.\nBesides the obvious artistic and entertainment purposes, the outcome of this project will constitute an interesting tool to de-identify and diversify the faces depicted in video training datasets, helping to protect the identity of volunteers, and to mitigate eventual age, gender, and ethnic dataset collection biases.\nResearch Team  Prof. Patrick Flynn (PI) Prof. Kevin Bowyer (PI) Prof. Adam Czajka (PI) Prof. Walter Scheirer (PI) Daniel Moreira (Postdoc) Sandipan Banerjee (PhD Student)  ","date":1559260800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559260800,"objectID":"537f8411954a4c4c6b9bc998a07a6d40","permalink":"https://danielmoreira.github.io/project/srefv/","publishdate":"2019-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/srefv/","section":"project","summary":"Synthesis of Realistic Example Face Videos.","tags":["Face Synthesis","Identity Synthesis","Video Synthesis","Biometrics"],"title":"SREFV","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Status: Ongoing, Funded by: DARPA\nAdvisor: Prof. Walter Scheirer\nThe Scientific Integrity (Sci-Int) project is an endeavor funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), whose goal is to develop solutions to identify misconduct in scientific research through the detection of image tampering in scientific papers.\nWorking together with the Universities of Purdue, South California (USC), Campinas (Unicamp), and the Politécnico di Milano, our team leads the development of techniques to (1) rule out false positive cases of misidentified misconduct, and to (2) better report and document misconduct practices in retraction notices.\nTo accomplish item (1), we plan to perform semantic analyses of the suspect paper cases, in order to identify situations in which duplications or manipulations of content were made with fair scientific purpose (e.g., to visually highlight or to better explain previous results).

The idea is to give to the user enough iris texture matching and non-matching information, so they can decided if the two given images depict the same eye or not.\n\nThe video above depicts a demo of the TSHEPII tool, with all the computer vision techniques added to the software.
